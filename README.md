# Apache Spark Deep Learning Advanced Recipes [Video]
This is the code repository for [Apache Spark Deep Learning Advanced Recipes [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/apache-spark-deep-learning-advanced-recipes-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789955309), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this video course, you’ll work through specific recipes to generate outcomes for deep learning algorithms—without getting bogged down in theory. From using LSTMs in generative networks to creating a movie recommendation engine, this course tackles both common and not so common problems so you can perform deep learning in a distributed environment. 
In addition, you’ll get access to deep learning code within Spark that you can reuse to answer similar problems or tweak to answer slightly different problems. You’ll learn how to predict real estate value using XGBoost. You’ll also explore how to create a movie recommendation engine using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. By the end of the course, you'll have the expertise to train and deploy efficient deep learning models on Apache Spark.
